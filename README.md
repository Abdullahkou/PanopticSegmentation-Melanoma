# Panoptic Segmentation of Nuclei and Tissue in Advanced Melanoma

This repository contains the code and resources for my bachelor's thesis, which focuses on panoptic segmentation of nuclei and tissue in advanced melanoma. The project is part of the [PUMA Challenge](https://puma.grand-challenge.org/), aiming to improve segmentation performance in histopathological images.
